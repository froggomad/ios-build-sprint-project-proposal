# Project Proposal for iOS Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below (Remove `<placeholders>` and add your answers)
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Team Members: `Kenny Dubroff`
2. App Name: `Lunchly`
3. App Description (3-5 sentences): 

    `Schedule your lunches with friends and colleagues. Create groups to keep everything organized. Vote on your favorite lunch spots - the place with the most votes wins! Set a reminder, and Lunchly will let you know when it's time to leave so you're never late for lunch again!`
    
4. Your #1 Customer (Who would use your app? Why now?)
 
 `Anyone with a lot of friends and/or colleagues knows what a pain it can be to agree on a lunch spot, and how unlikely it is that everyone will make it there on time. Busy professionals and social butterflys alike will appreciate Lunchly.`
    
5. Github code repository: `https://github.com/froggomad/Lunchly`
6. Github Project/Trello Board: `https://trello.com/b/zkBeOwrE/lunchly`
7. Create a Slack DM Group with your partner, TL, and Instructor and say "hi!"

## Part 1: Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 

1. Brainstorming (Photo / Sketch)
    1. Mind Map (15 minutes)
        1. Set a timer for 15 minutes
        2. Grab a piece of paper and write your app name in the center
        3. Add as many ideas and connections (Don't stop early, keep going until the timer ends)
        4. If you still have ideas, reset the timer and do it again
        5. Take a photo of your mind map and upload it to your proposal (YourName-Mindmap.jpg)
    2. Organize a List (15 minutes)
        1. Set a timer for 15 minutes
        2. Make a list on paper (or Markdown) and capture all your ideas from the mindmap
        3. If new ideas appear, write those down too
        4. Take a photo of your organized list and upload it to your proposal (YourName-List.jpg or YourName-List.md)
    3. Prioritize (5 minutes)
        1. What features does your #1 customer need most?
        2. Choose 3-5 features that make the core app experience
        3. Add these features to your `## Top Features` section
    4. Sketch (15 minutes)
        1. Draw a rectangle in the center of a paper
        2. Sketch a rough idea of what buttons, labels, images would be on the screen
        3. Repeat this for 3-5 of your top features
        4. Add annotations to your sketches (i.e.: point out how gesture interactions or animations might work)
        5. Take a photo of each mockup
    5. Share (15 minutes)
        1. Pair up with a fellow student and show them your idea (Screenshare on Zoom)
        2. Take notes and write down any of their ideas
2. If you have tons of ideas, set a timer again and keep going.
3. Don't filter yourself in the brainstorming phase, you want to capture everything and anything

## Top Features (Prioritize)

Add your top 3-5 features (core functionality) from the Prioritize brainstorming step. These should be things that are part of the MVP (not a log in screen). Build for the demo day (i.e.: Apple never shows how to log into the Apple ID on stage).

1. `<Feature 1: Plan a meetup with a group of people. This requires users, groups, and restaurants - in addition to notifications in order to be useful.>`
2. `<Feature 2 Filtered Search/category selection. This will help the user find what they're looking for more quickly>`
3. `<Feature 3 Ultimately this app would have a backend such as Firebase, but the app should still use CoreData to cache and maybe load a previous session>`

## Part 2: Project Plan

Take a step away from your computer and go for a walk. Your brain will continue to think about your app idea.

1. Add your tasks to your Kanban board (Github Project/Trello)
2. Be specific in your tasks so that they are actionable.
    1. "Create View Controllers" is vague and isn't clear when you're finished
    2. "Create Table View Controller for GIFCell rows" and "Create Custom GIFTableViewCell" are specific
3. Organize your tasks (Drag and drop)
    1. Break down large tasks into subtasks
    2. If you don't know how to do a task, add to research it (i.e: "Research: AVFoundation Video Thumbnails API" or "Read: Core Graphics Programming Guide")
4. Start on your most difficult task first
5. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
